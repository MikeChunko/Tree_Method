# Tree_Method
This was created in the Spring 2019 semester at Stevens Institute for CS 135 as an extra credit assignment.

The program is designed to use the tree method to solve logical problems, return #t if the logical expression is valid and #f if it is invalid. How to use the program is explained in comments within it.
